# Custom Depth of Field
## by SSyl
This is a simple mod that allows you to change the minimum focus distance and maximum focus distance of the game's depth of field.

The game's default minimum distance for Depth of Field is 50. I find that this makes closer objects in the game far too blurry. Through a bit of testing, 75 seems to be about the sweet spot for me (and is the mod's default) and anything over 100 is a bit too high. It all comes down to personal taste, however.

The game's default for max distance is 3000 which seems just fine to me. Anything higher and nothing gets blurred. If you wanted some extra blur in the distance you could lower it some. I left it at 3000 for this mod.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**How do I change the depth of field?** Run the mod once and it'll generate a config file at Valheim\BepInEx\config\SSyl.CustomDOF.cfg
**Is there an easier way to configure the depth of field?** The easiest would be by using the [ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager). This is installed by default if you used Vortex. Press F1 while in game and it'll let you change the values on the fly.

## Extra Information
I pretty much don't know anything about how depth of field works. I just know it blurs things in the distance based on what you/your camera is looking at. This mod just lets you change the game's built-in values to what you set in the config.
